    <h1>My Goals </h1> 
  <p> After high school, I am aiming to study a double major in Statistics and Economics or Data Science, and possibly minor in Literature at a four-year university. In college I hope to join a variety of clubs, activities, and engage in experiences outside of academics. I would love to study abroad at some point in order to see the world a little bit more (also because I love to travel.)<br><br> As of right now, I intend to also pursue higher education beyond my undergraduate degree. I hope to eventually pursue a career as a statistician for the government, or a large coorporation. Beyond my career, I hope to live in Toronto, Canada with my siblings and extended family.</p>
